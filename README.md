# Live Browser Transcription

This is a barebones project which transcribes audio directly from the browser using your mic thanks to [Deepgram](http://deepgram.com)'s AI Speech Recognition API. A tutorial can be found at <https://blog.deepgram.com/live-transcription-mic-browser/>

__This project exposes an API key on the client-side!__ You can set API keys to expire after a period of time, or manually revoke them via the API. 

## Usage

Download the `index.html` file and replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with a Deepgram API Key. Then open the file in your browser.
